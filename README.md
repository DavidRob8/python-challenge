This Python challenge was exacly that: a challenge. We had to use two different csv files, one with profit/loss data and the other with polling data. With these two sets of data, we had to produce an  analysis for each one.

For the PyBank portion of the module, I started off by locating and opening the csv file. Next, I defined my variables and initiated a For loop.

The For loop was used to loop through all the rows to calculate:
  1) The total number of months 
  2) The total of profit and loss during the given period
  3) The change in profit and loss during the given period
  4) The average of that change in profit and loss
  5) The greatest increase and the greatest decrease in profits and the dates they occurred.

The code concluded with printing the results, as well as exporting the results to a text file.

The PyPoll portion of the module was similar to the PyBank portion except with less calculations. Like in the PyBank portion, I started off by locating and opening the csv file, defining my variables, and initiated a For loop.

The For loop was used to loop through all the rows to calculate:
  1) The total number of votes 
  2) A list of candidate names that received votes, the percentage of votes they received, and their total vote count
  3) The winner of the election

As previously, the code concluded with printing the results, as well as exporting the results to a text file.
